GitHub Copilot assisted me in drawing a scene and optimizing the main function loop. Although I found creating a story for the game fairly simple, the difficult came with ending the loop input. I viewed examples that were auto-filled by Copilot to learn that I was incorrectly utilizing the “break” statement only needing to input it a single time towards the end after I defined a “retry” function to either cycle back or end the loop. In drawing a scene I also used Copilot in moderation to enhance the vocabulary and adjectives to make the objectives more appealing.
